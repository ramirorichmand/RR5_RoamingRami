## 💡 The Challenge

I went full circle and created my own Mini-Project - a ‘Space Themed Landing Page’ inspired by the BNTA AC in December 2022. The difference between the last landing page is that this is not e-commerce related.

## 🎯 Project Aims

This is a space travel landing page The objective was to create a visually stunning and user-friendly one-page layout, featuring various exciting sections such as a mobile view, low orbit, and detailed spacecraft information.

Get ready to blast off into a world of sleek design, intergalactic exploration, and spaceship specs. Stay tuned for an epic launch! 🚀👨‍🚀🌎🛰️💫👽🌌
